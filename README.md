# product_clustering
This csv file can be used if you're following along in Part 2 of my guide called Clustering Product Names with Python:
https://towardsdatascience.com/clustering-product-names-with-python-part-2-648cc54ca2ac

Under the section "Further labelling is optional", this csv contains the categories I manually created and can be joined to the table "result_labelled" to achieve the treemap in the guide.
